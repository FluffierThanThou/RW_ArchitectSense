Allows modders to combine buildables in subcategories.

# Important
**This is a functionality mod, it does nothing on its own** 
This mod is intended to provide functionality to other modders, and does nothing without custom XML and/or C# code.
If you're a modder, or want to try out subcategories, have a look at the Examples folder. 

# Features (for modders)
Architect Sense allows you to group designators for buildings and terrains (e.g. the buttons in the architect menu) together.
It is simple to configure with DesignationSubCategoryDefs in XML (see the Examples folder), and also exposes a number of methods
to handle dynamically creating categories, as well as finding and hiding individual designators.
